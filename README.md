Inputs:
1. I manually added column F, G and J to the color-coded file received from Jonathan. I ended up only using column J out of the new columns.
   Column J:
     (a) -1: no color or yellow
     (b) 0: Food at home
     (c) 1: Standard tax rates
     (d) 2: Special tax rates given JF code
3. There is a mistake in input file main/input/consumption_taxes/Sales taxes on goods/Raw/2010_aftertaxes.xlsx for Colorado. The raw file downloaded from tax foundation says 2.90 but the cleaned file somehow says 2.00. I manually corrected it in the input file.

Outputs:
1. Computed and saved standard tax rates, food tax rates, services tax rates for each sample year (2005, 2006, 2010, 2011, 2015, 2016)
2. Combined with the input color-coded file to produce tax rates by CEX items and state/year.
